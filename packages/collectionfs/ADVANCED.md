* cfs-handlebars
* cfs-filesystem
* cfs-gridfs
* cfs-s3

## Collections

Various MongoDB collections are created by CollectionFS and related packages.
Here's an explanation of what they are named and what their documents look like.

### name + ".files" (FS.Collection)

```js
{
  _id: "",
  collectionName: "",
  copies: {
    storeName: {
      _id: String, // the store ID
      name: String, // as saved in this store, potentially changed by beforeSave
      type: String, // as saved in this store, potentially changed by beforeSave
      size: Number, // as saved in this store, potentially changed by beforeSave
      utime: Date // when saved in this store
    }
  },
  name: String, // of the originally uploaded file
  type: String, // of the originally uploaded file
  size: Number, // of the originally uploaded file
  utime: Date, // of the originally uploaded file
  failures: {
    copies: {
      storeName: {
        count: Number,
        firstAttempt: Date,
        lastAttempt: Date,
        doneTrying: Boolean
      }
    }
  },
  chunks: [
    {
      start: Number, // the byte position at which this chunk starts in the complete file
      tempFile: String // the file path for the temporary chunk file stored in the temp dir
    }
  ]
}
```

### "storage." + storageAdapterType + "." + storageAdapterName + "." + storeName + ".files" (per store)

```js
{
  _id: "",
  cfs: "", // the FS.Collection name
  cfsId: "", // the _id in the CFS collection
  filename: "" // actual filename that was stored
}
```

### name + ".chunks"

Created by the GridFS storage adapter. These collections match the GridFS spec.

## Creating a Storage Adapter

To create a storage adapter, define an object constructor function that takes
a name as a first argument and any additional necessary settings as additional
arguments. Make it return an instance of FS.StorageAdapter, passing your API to
the FS.StorageAdapter constructor function. Here's an example:

```js
FS.MyStore = function(name, options) {
  // Prep some variables here

  return new FS.StorageAdapter(name, {}, {
    typeName: 'storage.myadapter',
    get: function(identifier, callback) {
      // Use identifier to retrieve a Buffer and pass it to callback
    },
    getBytes: function(identifier, start, end, callback) {
      // Use identifier to retrieve a Buffer containing only
      // the bytes from start to end, and pass it to callback.
      // If this is impossible, don't include a getBytes property.
    },
    put: function(id, fileKey, buffer, options, callback) {
      // Store the buffer and then call the callback, passing it
      // an identifier that will later be the first argument of the
      // other API functions. The identifier will likely be the
      // fileKey, the id, or some altered version of those.
    },
    remove: function(identifier, callback) {
      // Delete the data for the file identified by identifier
    },
    watch: function(callback) {
      // If you can watch file data, initialize a watcher and then call
      // callback whenever a file changes. Refer to the filesystem
      // storage adapter for an example. If you can't watch files, then
      // throw an error stating that the "sync" option is not supported.
    },
    init: function() {
      // Perform any initialization
    }
  });
};
```

`getBytes` and `init` are optional. The others are required, but you should throw
an error from `watch` if you can't watch files. Your `put` function should check
for an `overwrite` option. If it's true, save the data even if you've already
saved for the given `id` or `fileKey`. If not, you may alter the `fileKey` as
necessary to prevent overwriting and then pass the altered `fileKey` to the
callback.

By convention, any official stores should be in the `FS` namespace
and end with the word "Store".

## Architecture

```
Client <---- (ddp/http) --- | CFS access point |
                            |  Security layer  |
                            | Storage adapters |
                              |    |    |    |
                Mongo–––––––––O    |    |    |
                Local––––––––––––––O    |    |
                Fileserver––––––––––––––O    |
                External server––––––––––––––O
```

## The Upload Process (DDP)

Here's a closer look at what happens when a file is uploaded.

### Step 1: Insert

All uploads initiate on a client. If a file is inserted on the server, the
data is already on the server, so no upload process is necessary.

An upload begins when you call `insert()` on an `FS.Collection` instance. The
`insert` method inserts the file's metadata into the underlying collection on
the client. If that is successful, it immediately calls `put()` on the `FS.File`
instance. This in turn calls `FS.uploadQueue.uploadFile()`, which kicks off
the data upload.

### Step 2: Transfer

The upload transfer queue's `uploadFile` method uses the file size and a
pre-defined chunk size to determine how many chunks the file will be broken into.
It then adds one task to its PowerQueue instance per chunk. Each chunk task does
the following:

1. Extracts the necessary subset (chunk) of data from the file.
2. Passes the data chunk to a server method over DDP.
3. Marks the chunk uploaded in a client-only tracking collection if the server
method reports no errors.

PowerQueue's reactive methods are used to report total progress for all current
uploads, but the custom client-only tracking collection is used to report progress
per file. (TODO: update this after PQ sub-queues are done and the transfer
queues are updated to use them)

### Step 3: Receive

Each data chunk is received by a DDP access point (a server method defined in
accessPoint.js). This method does the following:

1. Checks that incoming arguments are of the correct type.
2. If the `insecure` package is not used, checks the `insert` allow and deny
functions. If insertion is denied, the method throws an access denied error.
3. Passes the data chunk to the temporary store.
4. If the temporary store reports that it now has all chunks for the file,
retrieves the complete file from the temporary store and calls `fsFile.put()`
to begin the process of saving it to each of the defined stores.

### Step 4: Temporarily Store

The temporary store is managed by the `FS.TempStore` object. When the server method
calls `FS.TempStore.saveChunk()`, the chunk data is saved to a randomly named
temporary file in the server operating system's default temporary directory.
The path to this file is saved in the `chunks` array on the corresponding FS.File.
(The `chunks` property is available on an FS.File instance only on the server
because it is used strictly for server-side tracking.)

`saveChunk` calls a callback after saving the chunk. The second argument of
this callback is `true` if all chunks for the given file are now saved in the
temporary store (i.e., all chunks were uploaded so all file data is now present
on the server).

Using a temporary filesystem store like this ensures that chunks remain available
after an app or server restart, allowing the client to resume uploads. Chunks
are saved to the app server filesystem rather than GridFS in your MongoDB because it
is theoretically faster, especially when the mongo database is on a separate server.

NOTE: The first version of temp storage appended/wrote to a single temp file
per uploaded file, but there are issues with file locking and writing to
specific start-points in an existing file. By switching to 1 chunk = 1 temp
file, we have the freedom to have parallel chunk uploads in any order without
fear of file lock contention, and it's still really fast.

### Step 5: Store

After the server method calls `put()` on the complete uploaded file, this in
turn calls `saveCopies()` on its associated `FS.Collection` instance. `saveCopies`
loops through each copy/store you defined in the options and saves the file
to that store. If you defined a `beforeSave` function for the store, the file
passes through that function first. If a `beforeSave` returns `false`, this is
recorded in the `FS.File` instance and the file will never be saved to that store.

* If the store reports that it successfully saved the file, a reference string,
returned by the store, is stored in `fsFile.copies[storeName]`. This string will
be anything that the store wants to return, so long as it can be used later to
retrieve that same file.
* If the store reports that it was not able to save the file, the error is logged
in the `FS.File` instance. If the total number of failures exceeds the `maxTries`
setting for the store, a `doneTrying` flag is set to `true`. When `doneTrying`
is `false`, the FileWorker may attempt to save again later. (See the next step.)

### Step 6: Retry

The `FileWorker` (in fileWorker.js), searches all `FS.Collection` every 5
seconds (not configurable right now but could be) to see if there are any
storage failures that meet the criteria to be
retried (namely, if failure count > 0 and doneTrying is false). The file worker
then calls `saveCopies` for each file that is identified. (See the previous step.)

The `FileWorker` also does one more thing. If it identifies any files that have
been successfully saved to all defined stores, or that have failed to save the
maximum number of times for a store, or that won't be saved to a store because
`beforeSave` returned `false`, then it tells `FS.TempStore` to delete all the
temporary chunks for that file. They are no longer needed.

Note: One the temporary chunks are deleted, the "original" file will be no longer
available if all stores are modifying the original using a `beforeSave` function.

## The Download Process (DDP)
